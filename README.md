Arranges the icons of the Honeycomb plugin for Rainmeter

I got annoyed at trying to place Honeycomb icons on my desktop by hand. It felt dirty, so I wrote a script that will
arrange them for me. Simply speaking, this program reads from and writes to the Rainmeter.ini file setting the
coordinates according to a hexagonal lattice structure. By default, the program will go through the list of activated
Honeycomb icons and arrange them from center outwards.
